# C++ CMake Project Template

A minimal, modern **C++ project template** using **CMake**.  
This repository is intended to be used as a **starting point** for new C++ projects, providing a clean structure, sensible defaults, and easy build commands.

## Features

- Modern CMake (CMake ≥ 3.16)
- C++17 standard enabled
- Out-of-source builds
- Works with:
  - Apple Clang (macOS)
  - GCC / Clang (Linux)
  - MSVC (Windows, with minor adjustments)
- Easy to extend for larger projects
