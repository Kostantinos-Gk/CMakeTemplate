# C++ CMake Project Template

A minimal, modern **C++ project template** using **CMake**.  
This repository is intended to be used as a **starting point** for new C++ projects, providing a clean structure, sensible defaults, and easy build commands.

## Features

- Modern CMake (CMake ≥ 3.16)
- C++17 standard enabled
- Out-of-source builds
- Works with:
  - Apple Clang (macOS)
  - GCC / Clang (Linux)
  - MSVC (Windows, with minor adjustments)
- Easy to extend for larger projects

## Project Structure

```text
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── README.md
├── src/
│   └── main.cpp
├── app/
└── build/            # Generated by CMake (not committed)
```

## Steps for Generate, Build, Run a Cmake project.

### New build, root project directory

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -S .. -B . # Option 1
cmake .. # Option 2
```

### Existing build, the generated project is updated

```bash
cd build
cmake .
```

```bash
./build/app/executable
```
